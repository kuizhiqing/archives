<font size=+2>The Challenge of the Brachistochrone</font><br>
<b>William Dunham</b><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this and so many other contributions,
the Bernoulli brothers left a significant mark 
upon mathematics of their day.
But one additional tale must be told of these
cantankerous, competitive, and contentious brothers,
a story that is surely one of the most fascinating
from the entire history of mathematics.</p>

<p>It began in June of 1696 when Johann Bernoulli
published a challenge problem in Leibniz&rsquo;s journal
<i>Acta Eruditorum</i>.
Obviously, a legacy of public challenge remained
from the days of Fior and Tartaglia.
Although contests were now conducted 
in the sedate pages of scholarly journals,
they retained their power to make or break reputations,
as Johann himself observed:</p>

<blockquote>&#133; it is known with certainty that 
there is scarcely anything which more greatly excites
noble and ingenious spirits to labors 
which lead to the increase of knowledge
than to propose difficult and at the same time
useful problems through the solution of which,
as by no other means,
they may attain to fame and build for themselves
eternal monuments among posterity.
</blockquote>

<p>Johann&rsquo;s particular challenge was a good one.
He imagined points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> at different
heights above the ground and not lying one directly
above the other.
There is certainly an infinitude of different curves
connecting these two points,
from a straight line, to an arc of a circle,
to any number of other wavy, undulating paths.
Now imagine a ball rolling from
<i>A</i> down to <i>B</i> along such a curve.
The time it take to complete the trip depends,
of course, on the curve&rsquo;s shape.
Bernoulli challenged the mathematical world
to find that one particular curve <i>AMB</i>
along which the ball will roll 
the <i>shortest</i> time.
He called this curve the &ldquo;brachistochrone&rdquo;
from the Greek words for &ldquo;shortest&rdquo;
and &ldquo;time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>An obvious first guess is to take <i>AMB</i>
as the straight line joining <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.
But Johann cautioned against this simplistic approach:</p>

<blockquote>&#133; to forestall hasty judgment,
although the straight line <i>AB</i> is indeed
the shortest between the points <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>,
it nevertheless is not the path traversed 
in the shortest time.
However the curve <i>AMB</i>, whose name I shall
give if no one else discovered it 
before the end of this year,
is one well-known to geometers.
</blockquote>

<p>Johann gave the mathematical world
until January 1, 1697,
to come up with a solution.
However, when his deadline arrived,
he had received but one solution,
from the &ldquo;celebrated Leibniz&rdquo;, who</p>

<blockquote>has courteously asked me
to extend the time limit to next Easter
in order than in the interim 
the problem might be made public &#133;
that no one might have cause to complain
of the shortness of the time allotted.
I have not only agreed to this commendable request
but I have decided to announce myself
the prolongation
and shall now see who attacks this excellent
and difficult question and after so long a time
finally masters it.
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, Johann waxed enthusiastic 
about the rewards of solving his brachistochrone
problem.
Recalling that he himself knew the solution,
one finds his remarks about the glories
of mathematics a bit self-serving:</p>

<blockquote>
Let who can seize quickly the prize which we have promised
to the solver.
Admittedly this prize is neither of gold nor silver,
for these appeal only to base and venal souls. &#133;
Rather, since virtue itself is its own 
most desirable reward
and fame is a powerful incentive,
we offer the prize,
fitting for the man of noble blood,
compounded of honor, praise, and approbation &#133;
</blockquote>

<p>In this passage, it sounds as though Johann
was setting himself up for another triumph 
over poor Jakob.
But he had a different target more squarely
in his sights.  Wrote Johann:</p>

<blockquote>&#133; so few have appeared to solve
our extraordinary problem,
even among those who boast that through special methods
&#133; they have not only penetrated 
the deepest secrets of geometry
but also extended its boundaries 
in marvellous fashion;
although their golden theorems,
which they imagine known to no one,
have been published by others long before.
</blockquote>

<p>Could anyone doubt that the &ldquo;golden theorems&rdquo;
he referred to were the techniques of fluxions,
or that the object of his scorn was none other than
Isaac Newton himself,
a man who claimed to have known about calculus
long before Leibniz had published it in 1684?
Then, to leave no doubt about the explicit nature
of his challenge,
Johann put a copy in an envelope 
and mailed it off to England.</p>

<p>Of course, in 1697,
Newton was deeply involved with matters
of the Mint, and, as he himself admitted,
he no longer felt the agility of mind
that characterized his mathematical heyday.
Newton was then living in London
with his niece, Catherine Conduitt,
and she picks up the story:</p>

<blockquote>When the problem in 1697 was sent 
by Bernoulli &mdash; Sir I.N. was in the midst
of the hurry of the great recoinage
and did not come home till four 
from the Tower very much tired,
but did not sleep till he had solved it,
which was by four in the morning.
</blockquote>

<p>Even late in life and tired from a hectic day&rsquo;s work,
Isaac Newton triumphed where most of Europe
had failed!
It was a remarkable display of the powers
of the great British genius.
He had clearly felt his reputation and honor
were on the line;
after all, both Bernoulli and Leibniz
were waiting in the wings to publish
their own solutions.
So Newton rose to the occasion and solved
the problem in a matter of hours.
Somewhat exasperated, he is reported at one point
to have said,
&ldquo;I do not love &#133; to be &#133;
teezed by foreigners about Mathematical things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Back in Europe, as Easter neared,
a few solutions came into the hands of Johann Bernoulli.
The curve that everyone was seeking &mdash;
one that &ldquo;is well-known to geometers&rdquo; &mdash;
was none other than an upside-down cycloid.
As we have noted, 
this important curve was studied by Pascal and Huygens,
but neither of these mathematicians 
had realized that it would also serve
as the curve of quickest descent.
Johann wrote with characteristic hyperbole,
&ldquo;&#133; you will be petrified
with astonishment 
when I say that precisely this cycloid
&#133; of Huygens is our required brachistochrone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Easter, the challenge period had expired.
All together, Johann had received five solutions.
There was his own and the one from Leibniz.
His brother Jakob came through
(perhaps to Johann&rsquo;s dismay)
with a third,
and the Marquis de l&rsquo;Hospital
added a fourth.
Finally, there was a submission bearing 
an English postmark.
Opening it, Johann found the solution correct,
although anonymous.
He clearly had met his match in the person
of Isaac Newton.
Although unsigned, the solution bore the
unmistakable signs of supreme genius.</p>

<p>There is a legend &mdash; 
probably of dubious authenticity
but nonetheless of great charm &mdash;
that Johann, partially chastened,
partially in awe,
put down the unsigned document 
and knowingly remarked,
&ldquo;<acronym title="Ex ungue leonem.">I recognize the lion by his paw.</acronym>&rdquo;</p>
